Discussion Log for lightup project: 
We discussed the general ideas for the problem constraints with Kyle, as well as the idea of using absolute values on our constraints. 
The absolute values are to make sure that no unexpected behavior occurs due to python passing variables as references.
Additionally, Tom went to office hours to discuss the cases for the number tiles, and talked to you, Kyle, and Tristan about those cases.

We used this website to understand how to use the itertools combinations function:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/itertools-combinations-module-python-print-possible-combinations/ 
Our Combos() function follows the same format from that article.
