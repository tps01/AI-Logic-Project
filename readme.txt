This was a group project for my AI class with Prof. Fitzsimmons. I worked with Jackson Hoy.
This is a program that solves light-up puzzles. examples can be found at: https://www.puzzle-light-up.com/ 
Below is the readme that we wrote for the project at the time we made it, and it includes instructions on running the program.
To run the program, you will need a python environment on your system. (We used python3)

A description of the lightup problem can be found in project2.pdf.


In the command line, type:

Valid puzzle files can be found in the project directory- labeled “puzzle_.txt”   (_ is a number 1 through 5)


Example calls of the program:
